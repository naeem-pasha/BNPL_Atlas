        <p>Dear Atlas Honda </p>
        <p>
          This is to inform you that our financing customer has decided not to
          proceed with the purchase of the vehicle. Accordingly, the sale
          transaction between MBL and you, pertaining to the vehicle with
          chassis number {data.engineNo}, stands cancelled.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may now proceed with the disposal or resale of the said vehicle at
          your discretion. Thank you for your continued cooperation.
        </p>
